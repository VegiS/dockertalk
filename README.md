Demo - Using Docker in production: Get started today!
=====================================================

*Version: Docker CE v17.06*

*A talk by Clarence Bakirtzidis - Email: [clarence.bakirtzidis@elabor8.com.au](mailto:clarence.bakirtzidis@elabor8.com.au), Twitter: [@clarenceb_oz](https://twitter.com/clarenceb_oz)*

We will be using [Docker for AWS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/) Community Edition (CE).

There are two ways to deploy Docker for AWS:

* With a pre-existing VPC
* With a new VPC created by Docker

You can use either the AWS Management Console (browser based) or use the AWS CLI (command-line based).

**In this tutorial we will use a new VPC created by Docker and the AWS CLI.**

## Prerequisites

* Access to an AWS account with permissions to use CloudFormation and to create the following objects (see [full set of required permissions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/iam-permissions/)):
    * EC2 instances + Auto Scaling groups
    * IAM profiles
    * DynamoDB Tables
    * SQS Queue
    * VPC + subnets and security groups
    * ELB
    * CloudWatch Log Group
* SSH key in the AWS region where you want to deploy (required to access the completed Docker install)
* AWS account that supports EC2-VPC (See the [FAQ for details about EC2-Classic](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/faqs/))

*It is recommended that you do not use your AWS root account and instead create a new IAM user.  You can either grant them [all these permissions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/iam-permissions/) or make them an admin.  We will use a service role with CloudFormation that only has minimum required permissions.*

## Install the AWS CLI and configure your AWS access keys

TODO

## Provision a Docker for AWS cluster

**Note**: You must have created an EC2 ssh key pair in the desired region before creating the cluster. the keypair name must be called `DockerTutorial`.

Make a copy of the `aws_vars.sh.template` file and called it `aws_vars.sh`
Set the required values environment variables:

* `AWS_PROFILE` or leave blank for default profile
* `AWS_REGION`
* `CF_ROLE_ARN` or leave blank to use your IAM user permissions

```sh
./create_stack.sh

# ==>
Creating the CloudFormation Stack...
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:ap-southeast-2:XXXXXXXXXX:stack/DockerTutorial/7adc6f40-99d5-11e7-a360-50fa575f6862"
}
```

After some time, check the status:

```sh
./describe_stack.sh
{
    "Stacks": [
        {
            "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:ap-southeast-2:899051371423:stack/DockerTutorial/7adc6f40-99d5-11e7-a360-50fa575f6862",
            "Description": "Docker CE for AWS 17.06.1-ce (17.06.1-ce-aws1)",
            ...snip...
            "StackStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
            ...snip...

        }
    ]
}
```

When the stack is ready, the `StackStatus` will be `CREATE_COMPLETE`.
If the stack creation fails, the `StackStatus` will be `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`.

## Setup the local environment to talk to a Swarm Manager

Find a Docker Swarm Manager instance public IP:

```sh
./get_manager_ips.sh
# ==>
54.79.9.120

Open an ssh tunnel to the manager so you can use `docker` commands directly with the Docker for AWS swarm.

First, add your SSH keypair PEM file to your SSH agent or keychain:

```sh
# Use the path to your SSH keypair PEM file location:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/DockerTutorial.pem
```

```sh
./ssh_tunnel.sh 54.79.9.180
# ==>
Type: export DOCKER_HOST=localhost:2374
```

Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable and test connection to the Docker swarm manager:

```sh
export DOCKER_HOST=localhost:2374
docker info

...snip...
Server Version: 17.06.1-ce
...snip...
Labels:
 os=linux
 region=ap-southeast-2
 availability_zone=ap-southeast-2b
 instance_type=t2.small
 node_type=manager
...snip...
```

## Verify your swarm nodes are up and running

```sh
docker node ls

# ==>
ID                            HOSTNAME                                           STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS
6r7o5rv4x3pv3757ik2y5jm6j *   ip-172-31-21-75.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal    Ready               Active              Leader
a3o4uvlpdtrbcpxwu9hou4fsf     ip-172-31-10-93.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal    Ready               Active
i75ybtjkpdfq2dm8v0lojj7mo     ip-172-31-38-221.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal   Ready               Active
q3dmtefzvtd075rsfdgl8dxxp     ip-172-31-25-160.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal   Ready               Active
```

## Running the app locally

Use `docker-compose` to deploy the app locally (using Docker for Mac/Windows or to a Docker host created with Docker Machine).

## Deploy voting app to Docker for AWS

Use `docker stack deploy` with a Docker Compose V3 format YAML file to deploy the app.

## Deploy the Swarm Visualiser

## Deploy Portainer

## Deploy Logging

## Deploy Monitoring

## Get everyone to vote via the custom domain

## No volumes: Drain node, state is lost

## With Volumes (Cloudstor) - drain node, move to another node (state is retained)

## Scaling up / down

## Rolling updates (V1 -> V2) â€“ Zero downtime

## Teardown
